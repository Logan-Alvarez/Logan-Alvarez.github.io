        <h3>Hi, I'm Logan. Nice to meet you.</h3>
        <p>
          My past experience has lead me to embark on a new journey of web
          development. I'm a graduate of Grand Circus tech bootcamp where I
          studied the front-end MERN stack. My career focus is to provide
          exceptional UI/UX design and along the way, learn more advanced tricks
          of the trade.

          I'd like to share some of my personal interest outside of work. I find
          enjoyment out of kayaking, fishing, biking, snowboarding, and working
          out. If I'm not doing those activities I'm usually playing video games
          or listening to music.
